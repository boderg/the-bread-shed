# THE BREAD SHED

- The Bread Shed is the bread and butter of everyones lunch, it is a sandwich shop that sells homemade sandwiches along with snacks and drinks. 
- It is a place where anyone can grab a quick bite to eat for breakfast or lunch. 
- The site is designed so that customers can view the menu and make a decision on what they might like to eat or drink before they arrive at the shop. 
- The customer can also phone their order through so that it is pre-made and ready for them upon arrival at the store.
- The Bread Shed website is designed with ease in mind and is divided into menu pages where the food items are seperated by type.
- The target audience for this website is anyone that is looking for something that is quick and easy to obtain and healthy to eat.
- Included below are two mockup images of The Bread Shed website.

## UX

- The design was created initially as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop. 
- It was designed with ease of use in mind and mobile use at the forefront. This is so users can view what is on offer while out and about.
- Once the wireframe was created, the web pages were built with a clean look and ease of navigation in mind, so you are never more than two clicks from a menu.

### Colour Scheme

- The colours chosen are Bisque and Black.
- These two colours were chosen as they compliment each other and the aesthetic of the background image. They are also subtle and easy on the eye and have a good contrasting visiblity.

- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` used for primary text.
- `rgba(255, 228, 196, 0.7)` used for primary highlights.
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` used for secondary text.
- `rgba(255, 228, 196, 0.7)` used for secondary highlights.
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` used for borders.
- `rgba(255, 228, 196, 0.6)`used for text backgrounds.

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

- Two fonts were chosen from Google fonts as follows.

- [Concert One](https://fonts.google.com/?query=concert+one) was used for the primary headers, titles and general text.
This font was chosen for it's bold and rounded aesthetic.

- [Shadows Into Light](https://fonts.google.com/?query=shadows) was used for all menu text and text entry fields.
This font was chosen for it's hand written aesthetic that I wanted to use for the menu items, portraying a hand written menu.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, specifically as the social media and copyright icons in the footer.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
